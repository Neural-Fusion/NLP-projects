üß† Natural Language Processing (NLP) ‚Äì Introduction 

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on enabling machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language. NLP bridges the gap between human communication and computer understanding, powering applications like chatbots, translators, sentiment analyzers, and voice assistants.

üîç Key Fields in NLP:
	‚Ä¢	Text Classification: Categorizing text into predefined labels (e.g., spam detection, topic labeling).
	‚Ä¢	Sentiment Analysis: Detecting the sentiment behind text (positive, negative, neutral).
	‚Ä¢	Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identifying and classifying names of people, places, dates, etc.
	‚Ä¢	Part-of-Speech Tagging (POS): Identifying grammatical roles of words (noun, verb, adjective).
	‚Ä¢	Machine Translation: Automatically translating text from one language to another.
	‚Ä¢	Text Summarization: Generating concise summaries from longer documents.
	‚Ä¢	Question Answering: Automatically answering questions based on given texts or datasets.
	‚Ä¢	Speech Recognition & Generation: Converting speech to text and vice versa.
	‚Ä¢	Language Modeling: Predicting the next word or sequence in text for generation tasks (e.g., GPT models).

‚öôÔ∏è Common NLP Technologies & Tools:
	‚Ä¢	Libraries/Frameworks:
	‚Ä¢	NLTK ‚Äì Classical NLP techniques (tokenization, stemming, parsing).
	‚Ä¢	spaCy ‚Äì Fast NLP with pre-trained pipelines and industrial strength.
	‚Ä¢	Transformers (Hugging Face) ‚Äì State-of-the-art language models like BERT, GPT, RoBERTa.
	‚Ä¢	Gensim ‚Äì Topic modeling and word embeddings (Word2Vec, LDA).
	‚Ä¢	Stanford NLP ‚Äì Academic NLP tools with coreference resolution and dependency parsing.
	‚Ä¢	Models & Techniques:
	‚Ä¢	Rule-based systems ‚Äì Manually defined patterns/rules.
	‚Ä¢	Statistical models ‚Äì Naive Bayes, HMMs, CRFs.
	‚Ä¢	Deep Learning ‚Äì RNNs, LSTMs, Attention, Transformers (BERT, GPT).

#Datasets:
	‚Ä¢	IMDB, SQuAD, CoNLL, TREC, GLUE, Wikipedia dumps, Common Crawl.
